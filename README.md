# AI-Bus-Trip-Planner-ADK-Capstone-Project
This project demonstrates an AI-powered bus trip planner agent, created for the Kaggle Capstone Project using the Agent Development Kit (ADK). The agent helps users plan bus journeys from home to college (and back), with features like interactive memory, custom trip scheduling, and dynamic tool invocation.
